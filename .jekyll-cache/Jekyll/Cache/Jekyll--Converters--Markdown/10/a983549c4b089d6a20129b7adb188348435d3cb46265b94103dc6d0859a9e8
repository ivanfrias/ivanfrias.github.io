I"ã<p>This is my first post here! I have an account on medium and also a blog
on wordpress (which I didnâ€™t care too much for the past few years) that I am
putting out-of-service for now. In fact this is an attempt to force me and
to plan &amp; contribute to the community.</p>

<p>My first idea is to create a list of technologies and concepts Iâ€™ll be exploring for the next month.
Each month Iâ€™ll make another list and so on. And Iâ€™ll be writing about those on a ( hope to be )
an easier way or an easy approach to the subject. Here are the ideas for July 2018:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Natural Processing Language (NPL)</li>
  <li>Machine Learning (ML)</li>
  <li>Deep learning (DL)</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep posted for updates on the content.</p>
