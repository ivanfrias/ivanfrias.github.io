I"¼<h3 id="who-am-i">Who Am I</h3>

<p>My name is Ivan. Iâ€™m a software developer, based in Portugal. I am a simple person with a good taste for life. I usually enjoy relaxing while drinking a glass of wine.
I have a passion for music since child, which made me want to learn how to play an instrument. Influenced by the hard &amp; heavy acts of 80â€™s, I embrace the guitar learning path to these days! Every now and then you can also find me at some arena ( sadly not playing.. ), but enjoying a good show.</p>

<p>Netflix, Xbox, you name it. I am up for it. But I also enjoy reading a good book from times to times..Or attending a stand-up comedy show.
Technology in general is also a passion, both from the consumer standpoint but also from the perspective of someone that is actually capable of building and creating software.</p>

<p>The beggining of 2017 showed me that there was time to move on, and so I was reference by a fellow colleague to join the solution engineering team part of the services organization at Fuze Inc. To this time I canâ€™t express how really happy I am to be able to work for a company without physical boundaries, truly disruptive when it comes to worksplaces and their significance in the context of the workforce of the future.</p>

<h3 id="what-have-i-done">What Have I Done</h3>

<p>Initially started working for a smaller business, writing apps in .NET. Later ( 2010 ) Iâ€™ve decided to pursue other challenges, and so I joined Altice ( former PT InovaÃ§Ã£o ). That gave me resillience needed to work on projects with tight schedules &amp; interesting technical challenges that arises from the fact that project most of the times are â€¦ legacy!</p>

<p>By the end of 2013 I no longer see myself doing the same stuff over and over again so it was time to move on. It was time to join CarMediaLab. This small startup based in Bruchsal, Germany developed hardware and software for the automative industry. I was hired to help build front-end and back-end solutions that connected to their hardware which presented me with the chance of writing some neat software using Java and some cutting edge technologies like Vaadin. Very cool experience, also amazing team there!</p>
