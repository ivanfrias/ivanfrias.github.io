I"Ÿ<p>As part of the â€˜new year resolutionâ€™ Iâ€™ve commited myself to (at least) try to keep up with the new technologies, and in sometimes old or not-so-new-but-still-relevant technologies.</p>

<p>Last year we saw the rise of cryptocurrency-based companies. The language of the web remains javascript, through the likes of React, AngularJS and Vue.js . You can read <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-and-topics-to-learn-in-2019-b4142f38df20">this article</a> by Eric Elliot. It describes in detail the trends and where we are heading to.</p>

<p>As a kind-of note to myself ( hence the title! ) I am leaving here a list of technologies Iâ€™d like to learn or refresh during this year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GraphQL</li>
  <li>Bit</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>AngularJS</li>
  <li>Typescript</li>
  <li>Elm</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Babel</li>
  <li>Java</li>
</ul>

<p>See you next time!</p>
