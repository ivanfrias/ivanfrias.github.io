I"v<p>Every year, Fuze organizes the SKO - Sales Kick-off. During three days, some organizations of the company gather together to line-up &amp; prepare the entire year.</p>

<p>It was time to review 2018, analyse some case-studies (what went well, what went no so good), and get some inspiration for the upcoming year!</p>

<p>As someone who works remotely 8/5 it was very important to meet with my counterparts. I just now realized how important it is to know that someone behind a PC monitor is actually real! We discussed work, what can we improve and what is up next on the pipeline.</p>

<p>Looking forward to continue to work with this amazing team!</p>

<p>Together we are #onefuze !</p>
