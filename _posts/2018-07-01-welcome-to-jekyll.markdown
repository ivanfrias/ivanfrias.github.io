This is my first post here! I have an account on medium and also a blog
on wordpress (which I didn't care too much for the past few years) that I am
putting out-of-service for now. In fact this is an attempt to force me and
to plan & contribute to the community.

My first idea is to create a list of technologies and concepts I'll be exploring for the next month.
Each month I'll make another list and so on. And I'll be writing about those on a ( hope to be )
an easier way or an easy approach to the subject. Here are the ideas for July 2018:
* Natural Processing Language (NPL)
* Machine Learning (ML)
* Deep learning (DL)


Keep posted for updates on the content.
