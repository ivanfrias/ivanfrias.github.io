Every year, Fuze organizes the SKO - Sales Kick-off. During three days, some organizations of the company gather together to line-up & prepare the entire year.

It was time to review 2018, analyse some case-studies (what went well, what went no so good), and get some inspiration for the upcoming year!

As someone who works remotely 8/5 it was very important to meet with my counterparts. I just now realized how important it is to know that someone behind a PC monitor is actually real! We discussed work, what can we improve and what is up next on the pipeline.

Looking forward to continue to work with this amazing team!

Together we are #onefuze !
