As part of the 'new year resolution' I've commited myself to (at least) try to keep up with the new technologies, and in sometimes old or not-so-new-but-still-relevant technologies.

Last year we saw the rise of cryptocurrency-based companies. The language of the web remains javascript, through the likes of React, AngularJS and Vue.js . You can read [this article](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-and-topics-to-learn-in-2019-b4142f38df20) by Eric Elliot. It describes in detail the trends and where we are heading to.

As a kind-of note to myself ( hence the title! ) I am leaving here a list of technologies I'd like to learn or refresh during this year:

- GraphQL
- Bit
- React
- AngularJS
- Typescript
- Elm
- Python
- Babel
- Java
