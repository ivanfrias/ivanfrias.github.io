Hi! My name is Ivan Frias, I'm based in Portugal and currently working as a
Software Developer for [Fuze INC.](http://www.fuze.com) I've studied
Computer Engineering by [ESTG-IPL](https://www.ipleiria.pt/estg/) which gave me
needed tools to work on the field.

I've decided recently to start documenting my learning process so I decided to
create this blog, called 'Work in progress'. The name is self-explanatory, since
mostly everything is work in progress these days.

For the past year, I've been working with web technologies specially Javascript,
( [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Electron](https://electronjs.org), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org) ) building & helping to create cross-platform solutions for our customers on the
UCaaS ecosystem.

I've also worked for other industries most notably Accounting, Telecommunications & Automotive industries.
I have developed for other platforms ( Java and .NET ). I believe that the flexibility
and being able to change the mindset for other projects is for sure a big plus for me.
